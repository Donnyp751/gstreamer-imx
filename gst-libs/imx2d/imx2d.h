 * This is the main function of a blitter. It blits (copies)
 * pixels from @source to the destination surface (passed to
 * @imx_2d_blitter_start). When doing that, it also performs
 * flipping, rotation, blending, and scaling.
 *
 * The blitter transfers pixels from a source region in the @source
 * surface to a destination region in the destination surface.
 * The regions are determined by the source and destination
 * regions in @params. If the source region pointer there
 * is set to NULL, then the entire @source surface is the source
 * region. Same goes for the destination surface and the destination
 * region in @params. If @params itself is set to NULL, this
 * function behaves as if an @Imx2dBlitParams structure were
 * passed with the source and destination regions set to NULL.
 *
 * The source surface must exist until the sequence that was begun
 * with @imx_2d_blitter_start is ended with @imx_2d_blitter_finish.
 * This is because blitters can queue up commands internally and
 * execute them asynchronously.
 *
 * Scaling is determined by the source and destination regions.
 * The pixels from the source region are transferred into the
 * destination region. If these two regions do not have the
 * same size, then the source pixels are scaled to make sure
 * they fit in the destination region.
 *
 * If @params is set to NULL, default parameters are used.
 * These are: NULL source and destination regions,
 * @IMX_2D_ROTATION_NONE as rotation, and 255 as the alpha value.
 * In other words, the default parameters produce a simple blit
 * operation with scaling as-needed (as explained above).
 *
 * See @imx_2d_blitter_start for an important note about calling
 * this from a particular thread.
